pip freeze > requirements.txt

EXPLANATION
pip freeze is a command in Python that allows you to see what modules you have installed with the pip install command. It outputs a list of all the installed packages and their versions in a format that can be used to recreate the same environment using a requirements.txt file. This file can be generated by running the command pip freeze > requirements.txt
