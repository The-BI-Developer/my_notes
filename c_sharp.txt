#CREATE A PROJECT FIRST
dotnet new console -o <directory_name> //note -o is output and new console is application type e.g. can be replaced by a web app

1. navigate to app directory and then code . to set app as workspace
2. edit the program.cs (rename if you like) to whatever is desired

For beginner:
1. stick to one .cs file
2. don't worry about other created folders by .net

#NET ANALOGY
.net is the theatre and c# is the script
